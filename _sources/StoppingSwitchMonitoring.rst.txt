Stopping Switch Monitoring
==========================

By default, monitoring is enabled for discovered switches. You should stop monitoring a switch if you want to replace the switch or bring down the monitored port count to within the licensing limit.

Before you can stop monitoring a switch, you must have the following:

 * SAN-Discover Setup privilege with read/write permission

When you stop monitoring a switch, the following occurs:

 * Data collection on the switch stops.
 * You no longer receive SNMP traps and SYSLOG messages.
 * You can no longer perform feature-specific operations, such as zoning or downloading firmware.
 * Any scheduled operations on the switch are stopped.
 * The switch is removed from the |product| topology and inventory.

NOTE You cannot stop monitoring the seed switch.

When you stop monitoring a switch, you do not lose historical data, such as port statistics. So, for example, if you wanted to delete a switch from |product|, you could stop monitoring the switch, back up necessary data, and then delete the switch.

To stop monitoring a switch, perform the following steps:

#. Click the Settings icon, and then select **Network Monitoring > Fabric Discovery**.

   The Discovered Fabrics page displays all fabrics that have been discovered.

#. Click the fabric name to open the fabric drill-down page, which displays the list of switches in the fabric.

#. Select the switches that you want to stop monitoring, and click **Stop Monitoring**.

The **Status** column now shows "Unmonitored" for the switch.
