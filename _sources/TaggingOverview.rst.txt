Tagging Overview
================

Although your network can contain thousands of objects (ports, switches, fabrics), sometimes you might want to monitor and manage just a small subset of these objects, based on common characteristics.

For example, you might want to do the following:
   * Show a topology with only storage-facing ports.
   * Generate an inventory or health status report for all device-attached ports.
   * View events that originated from switches in rack 1 and rack 2 in the data center.
   
To organize your network into groups that share similar characteristics, |product| provides collections, tags, and filters.
