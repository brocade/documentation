Drill-Down Pages
----------------

Clicking a fabric name, switch name, or port name in a table opens a drill-down

The drill-down page is different depending on the context. For example, the 
drill-down page for a fabric in the **Inventory** page is different from the 
drill-down page for the same fabric in the **Discovery** page.
