Discovering a Fabric
====================

You must discover a fabric before you can monitor and manage it.

Before you can discover a fabric, you must have the following:
  * SAN-Discover Setup privilege with read/write permission
  * IP address and login credentials for the seed switch
  
Use the following procedure to discover a fabric.

 #. Click the **Settings** icon ( |SettingsIcon| ), and then select **Network Monitoring > Fabric Discovery**.

    The Discovered Fabrics page displays all fabrics that have been discovered.

 #. Click the **Add Fabric** ( |AddButton| ) button in the top right corner of the page.

 #. Enter the IP address, username, and password of the seed switch in the **Add Fabric** dialog box.
    
    The IP address can be in IPv4 or IPv6 format.

    By default, SNMPv3 is automatically selected and configured.

 #. Click **OK**.

    If the seed switch is enabled with Virtual Fabrics and has more than one logical switch, you must select which logical fabrics to discover.

    The **Add Fabric** dialog box display a list of the logical switches configured on the seed switch. Each logical switch corresponds to a logical fabric, indicated by the fabric ID (FID). The **Name** is the logical switch name, not the logical fabric name.

    The dialog box displays only the logical switches that have not yet been discovered.
