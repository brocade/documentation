   The Inventory page displays the managed entity objects.

   .. note:: The following steps show how to apply tags to one or more objects at the same time. Alternatively, if you want to tag a single object, you can click the name in the Inventory page and edit the tags in the drill-down page for that object.

#. Click the **More** button ( |MoreButton| ) in the upper right corner of the page, and then select **Bulk Edit**.

   A column of checkboxes displays to the left of the names.

#. Select one or more objects to tag.

#. Click **Edit** in the upper right corner of the page, and then select **Edit Tags**.

#. In the **Edit Tags** dialog box, enter the tags you want to add and remove for the selected objects.

   Enter the tags as a comma-separated list with no spaces. A tag can be up to 64 characters long. Tags are case-sensitive and can include alphanumeric characters and the underscore ( _ ).

   If you want to modify an existing tag, you must remove it and add the new tag, which you can do at the same time.

   In the following screenshot, the tag "DC1" is added to the selected objects. Additionally, a previous tag was misspelled, so the misspelled tag ("Raack1" is removed and replaced with the correct tag ("Rack1").
